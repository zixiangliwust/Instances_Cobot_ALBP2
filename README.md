# Instances_Cobot_ALBP2
1)	Instances for assembly line balancing problem with single-type collaborative robots to minimize the cycle time  
This project contains the instances utilized in [1] (in folder of Instances_Singletype). To gain a more in-depth and thorough understanding of this problem, interested authors are encouraged to refer to [1].   

2)	Instances for assembly line balancing problem with multi-type collaborative robots to minimize the cycle time  
This project contains Instances_Multitype_by_Li generated in [2] and the Instances_Multitype_by_Weckenborg which is re-generated following the method in [3]. To gain a more in-depth and thorough understanding of this problem, interested authors are encouraged to refer to our relevant papers[2, 4-7].  

3)	Instances for cost-oriented assembly line balancing problem with multi-type collaborative robots to minimize the cycle time   
This project contains Instances_Multitype_by_Li generated in [2]. To gain a more in-depth and thorough understanding of this problem, interested authors are encouraged to refer to our relevant papers[2].  

4)	Instances for U-shaped assembly line balancing problem with multi-type collaborative robots to minimize the cycle time  
This project contains Instances_Multitype_by_Li generated in [2] utilized in [8]. To gain a more in-depth and thorough understanding of this problem, interested authors are encouraged to refer to our relevant papers [8].
